<a href="https://www.razorsbydorco.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/23-99-Women-4-Home-Remedies-That-Work-Best-for-Reducing-Ingrown-Hairs-Manuka-Honey.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-532" src="https://www.razorsbydorco.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/23-99-Women-4-Home-Remedies-That-Work-Best-for-Reducing-Ingrown-Hairs-Manuka-Honey-1024x492.png" alt="23-99-Women-4-Home-Remedies-That-Work-Best-for-Reducing-Ingrown-Hairs-Manuka-Honey" width="625" height="300" /></a>
When decreasing the appearance of annoying ingrown hairs is a priority, you can count on the antibacterial characteristics of <a href="http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/beauty/skincare/advice/a25802/8-best-natural-treatments-for-razor-burn/?__hstc=23243621.05b8342eb187debe9f12063ddb16af06.1468014158783.1471619053892.1471621656720.316&amp;__hssc=23243621.2.1471621656720&amp;__hsfp=1431223577">manuka honey</a>. This anti-inflammatory home remedy includes glucose oxidase, which is an enzyme that makes the honey acidic and a great source for swelling reduction. Additionally, the high content of sugar in manuka honey produces an environment without water, which makes it difficult for the bacteria that gathers in your ingrown hair follicles to thrive. These properties combine to not only relieve your skin from discomfort but keep it clean as well.
<h2><strong>Take Preventative Measures to Avoid Ingrown Hairs</strong></h2>
How can we prevent the problem of ingrown hairs in the first place? If shaving is mandatory for you, make sure you take care of your tools and prepare your skin. For example, <a href="https://www.razorsbydorco.co.uk/community/the-best-ways-to-shave-in-a-hurry/">moisturising your skin</a> is key to avoiding ingrown hairs. Make sure you soak your skin with water before you shave and then with lotion after you get rid of unwanted hairs. Additionally, replace your razor before it gets too dull to avoid ingrown hairs caused by dull blades. <a href="https://www.razorsbydorco.co.uk/community/erase-razor-burn-tips-and-techniques-for-sexy-summer-legs-all-year-long/?__hstc=23243621.05b8342eb187debe9f12063ddb16af06.1468014158783.1471619053892.1471621656720.316&amp;__hssc=23243621.2.1471621656720&amp;__hsfp=1431223577">Dull razors will no longer cut the hair, but rather they will pull at the hair, sometimes yanking from the root</a>. This can irritate the follicle, as well as introduce unwanted bacteria into the follicle.
Ingrown hairs can be a real issue, but you don't have to struggle without relief. The next time ingrown hairs become a problem for your skin, keep these tips in mind. You'll be thankful for every day you have with pain-free and glowing skin!
